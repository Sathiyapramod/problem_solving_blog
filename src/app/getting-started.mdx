# Getting Started with Programming 🎯

Welcome to your programming journey! This guide will help you set up your development environment and understand the basics.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Basic computer literacy
- Curiosity and willingness to learn!

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### 1. Choose Your First Programming Language

For beginners, we recommend starting with **Python** or **JavaScript**:

**Python** - Great for beginners, readable syntax, vast ecosystem
**JavaScript** - Web development, immediate visual feedback, runs everywhere

### 2. Install Python (Recommended for Beginners)

#### Windows

1. Download Python from [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Run the installer
3. Check "Add Python to PATH"
4. Verify installation: `python --version`

#### Mac

```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install python

# Or download from python.org
```

#### Linux

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

### 3. Install a Code Editor

**VS Code** (Recommended):

- Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Install Python extension
- Install Live Server extension (for web development)

**Alternative**: PyCharm, Sublime Text, or Vim

## Your First Program

Let's write your first "Hello, World!" program:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

**What this does:**

- `#` creates a comment (ignored by the computer)
- `print()` is a function that displays text
- The text in quotes is called a "string"

## Basic Concepts

### Variables

Variables store data that can change:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6
is_student = True

print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
```

### Data Types

- **String**: Text (e.g., "Hello")
- **Integer**: Whole numbers (e.g., 42)
- **Float**: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14)
- **Boolean**: True or False

### Basic Operations

```python
# Math operations
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)  # Addition: 13
print(a - b)  # Subtraction: 7
print(a * b)  # Multiplication: 30
print(a / b)  # Division: 3.333...
print(a // b) # Integer division: 3
print(a % b)  # Modulo (remainder): 1
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation: 1000
```

## Practice Exercise

Try this simple exercise:

```python
# Calculate the area of a rectangle
length = 10
width = 5
area = length * width
print(f"The area is: {area}")
```

## Next Steps

1. **Practice**: Write simple programs daily
2. **Read**: Go through our [Programming Basics](/programming-basics) section
3. **Build**: Start with small projects
4. **Join**: Participate in coding communities

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Python is not recognized"

- Make sure Python is added to PATH during installation
- Restart your terminal/command prompt

### "Permission denied"

- On Mac/Linux, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python`
- Check file permissions
